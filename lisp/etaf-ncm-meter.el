;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The now-playing page's spectrum follows the audio that is actually playing.
;; A second decoder reads the same source mpv plays, starting at the reported
;; position, and hands back mono samples; `etaf-ncm-meter-levels' turns the
;; newest block into one level per column with a Goertzel pass, so the bars move
;; with the music instead of a canned loop.
;;
;; The meter is optional everywhere.  Without ffmpeg, without a source, or after
;; the decoder dies, `etaf-ncm-meter-levels' returns quiet levels and the page
;; keeps rendering; `etaf-ncm-meter-live-p' tells the page which of the two it
;; is showing.
