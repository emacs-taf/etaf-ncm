;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The player is a text grid without container queries, so adaptivity is a
;; decision table.  This module owns that table, and it owns it in one place:
;;
;; - The layout tier follows from what the panes are made of, not from a
;;   screen size someone typed in.  The header and a row declare the columns
;;   their labels and actions need; the list pane's minimum is the larger of
;;   those; the breakpoint is that minimum plus the columns the sidebar and
;;   the side panel occupy.  Change a label or an action and every breakpoint
;;   follows.
;; - The vertical budget decides how many library rows fit.  Every tier spends
;;   a fixed number of rows on the header, the chip strip, the pane switch and
;;   the player bar; the model and the views read the same budget, so reserved
;;   and painted rows cannot disagree.
;; - The row plan decides which columns survive a narrow list: the song name
;;   never leaves, the artist folds into the name first, then the badge, then
;;   the album.  A variant is chosen by testing whether its fixed columns plus
;;   the name minimum fit, so a template change moves the choice with it.
;; - The chip plan keeps every library in the strip: the strip first drops its
;;   gaps and then narrows each chip to the icon's inset before a library
;;   could fall off the edge.
;; - A frame too small for that chrome uses the card family instead: `card'
;;   keeps the cover band, one content pane (lyrics, library or queue), the
;;   pane switch and the transport; `tile' is the same without the cover
;;   band.  The family starts where the compact player controls no longer fit
;;   side by side, or where the tier's chrome would leave the library fewer
;;   rows than a page is worth reading.
;; - The type scale has two sizes: the frame default for everything a reader
;;   acts on, and `etaf-ncm-font-meta' for secondary facts (subtitles,
;;   counters, hints, credits).  Emphasis uses weight, never a larger size, so
;;   wording can never change a fixed row height.  A short frame sheds whole
;;   lines (the subtitle, the hint) instead of shrinking type.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'etaf-ncm-theme)

;;; Type scale

(defconst etaf-ncm-font-meta 15
  "Face size, in Ebox reference pixels, of secondary text.
Subtitles, counters, hints and credits use this size; everything a reader
acts on uses the frame's default size.  Emphasis uses weight, not size, so a
row's height never follows its wording.  Fifteen reference pixels is about
11.25 pt on a 14 pt frame: clearly smaller, still readable.")
